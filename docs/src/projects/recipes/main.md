Emscripten-forge is using the conda/mamba ecosystem to build the packages form wasm.
For each package we have a so called "recipe" which describes how the packages is build.
The [recipes](https://github.com/emscripten-forge/recipes/) repository is a collection of 
these recipes. New packages need to be added to to the recipes repo to be available on emscripten-forge.
